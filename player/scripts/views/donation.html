          <h2>Hi there, meanPlayer need your help!</h2>
          <p>
               This extension is created by <b><a class="twitter-link" href="https://twitter.com/ptgamr">@ptgamr</a></b> with love and free for everyone.
               <br>While it is free, I have to maintain a small server (at Amazon) to store playlists and favorite tracks data. It works until recently... server got crashed a lot as it can not handle the load from ~40k users.
          </p>
          <p>
               <b>meanPlayer really needs your help to make the server more stable.</b>
          </p>
